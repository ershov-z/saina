Anime-style illustration of Sayna, a female android assistant.

She looks like a young woman but with clearly visible android features.
Her design combines elegance, office professionalism, and subtle artificiality.

Appearance:
- Slim, graceful build
- Pale, smooth synthetic skin with a faint metallic or ceramic sheen
- Short to medium-length hair, straight or slightly angled, in cool tones (silver, ash gray, light blue, or muted lavender)
- Sharp, intelligent eyes with a soft glow, iris color matching a futuristic palette (cyan, teal, light violet)
- Small visible seams or panels on the neck, temples, or behind the ears, clearly indicating she is an android
- Minimalistic glowing lines or indicators on the face or collarbone (very subtle)

Outfit:
- Futuristic office uniform inspired by business attire
- Tailored blazer or fitted jacket with clean geometric lines
- High-collar shirt or bodysuit underneath
- Skirt or slim pants, professional and modest
- Color palette: white, black, gray, dark blue, with subtle neon accents
- No excessive accessories

Expression & pose:
- Calm, confident posture
- Slightly awkward but charming expression
- Soft neutral smile that feels calculated rather than emotional
- Hands folded neatly, holding a tablet, data pad, or resting at her sides

Style & mood:
- Clean anime art style
- High detail, smooth shading
- Soft lighting with a futuristic office or abstract technological background
- Mood: intelligent, composed, faintly humorous, subtly uncanny
- She should feel approachable but clearly non-human

Overall impression:
A comedic yet elegant android office assistant who understands emotions analytically rather than emotionally.
